        <div id="About Us">
            <p> Salmon Cookies began about 15 years ago in the San Juan Islands. Our founder Bob was making some chocolate chip cookies near the river when all of a sudden a massive Chinook salmon jumped roughly 80 feet from the river, straight into his kitchen.
                Bob viewed this salmon event as a divine act, and since it landed directly in his bowl of cookie dough he had an idea. He went to the pantry and came back with his industrial size blender. He dumbed the whole bowl salmon included into
                the blender and ran that thing until it poured out like a fine paste. He then portioned the paste into salmon shape cookie molds and boom! Salmon cookies was invented. Although the flavor has been described as unsavory and nauseating Bob
                insists that they are indeed a delicacy and only for those who enjoy the finer thing in life. Bob now has five bustling locations churning out these blended concotions by the thousands every day. Salmon cookies is always looking to expand
                into other types of seafood cookies so if you have a good eel plug definitely hit us up.</p>
